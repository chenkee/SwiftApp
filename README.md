# Software Engineer Aplication for Swift  from Max Chen

I created this project created using Java.

This project contains two files: FizzBuzz.java, and FizzBuzzMainTest.java

Main fucntion is in FizzBuzz.java. It opens up a console application and you can enter a number to see results

FizzBuzzMainTest.java contains some unit tests done using JUnit
